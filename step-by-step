step-by-step process to achieve this:

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

- Incorporate all the relevant features you mentioned into your dataset.
- Calculate additional features based on historical data, such as rolling averages, trends over time, and ratios between different metrics.
- Encode categorical variables (positions, teams, home/away) using appropriate encoding techniques.

### 2. Train-Test Split:

- Divide your dataset into training and testing subsets. You mentioned training on weeks 1-5 and predicting week 6. Your training dataset should consist of weeks 1 to 5, and the testing dataset should be week 6.

### 3. Model Selection and Training:

Choose a suitable regression model (e.g., linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting) for your task.
Train the model using the training dataset, using the various features as inputs and the "actual points" as the target variable.

### 4. Model Evaluation:

Predict the "actual points" for the players in the testing dataset (week 6) using the trained model.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of your predictions compared to the actual scores.

### 5. Fine-Tuning and Refinement:

Analyze the model's performance metrics and consider tuning hyperparameters or adjusting features to improve prediction accuracy.

### 6. Full Model Application:

Once you're satisfied with the model's performance on the test set, you can train it on data up to week 6 to create a more generalized model.

### 7. Predictions for Future Weeks:

Use the trained model to predict player performance for forthcoming weeks (e.g., weeks 7, 8, and so on). Provide the model with the relevant features for each player in the respective weeks.

### 8. Real-Time Updates and Continuous Improvement:

Continuously update your model with the latest data as new weeks progress.
Monitor the accuracy of your predictions for new weeks and refine the model as necessary.

### 9. Evaluation of Future Weeks:

For each new week, compare your model's predictions with the actual outcomes to assess the model's ongoing accuracy.

### 10. Feedback Loop:

Use the discrepancies between predicted and actual points to identify areas for improvement in feature engineering, model selection, or other aspects of the prediction process.

### 11. Communication and Visualization:

Present the predicted points along with expert rankings, projected ESPN points, and other relevant data in an easily interpretable format. Visualizations can help convey the model's performance and predictions to stakeholders.
